# Privacy Policy For bot., Revision 1.0

This is some of the information the bot collects in a understandable and readable format.

- Usernames and user-ids
- What servers the bot is added to
- Commands invoked by those users (Specific server usage is not tracked)
- Time and date of when command was issued
- What files are fetched by the bot
- Errors that occur during operation

This is what is collected by default however, if another maintainer modifies the logging policy then the data collected my differ from this program.
